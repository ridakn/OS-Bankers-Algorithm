# OS-Bankers-Algorithm
Simulation of the banker’s algorithm 

1. Source code - BankersR.java 
    Given four test inputs in main function
    Option to enter user input
    Each request that’s accepted, rejected and currently allocated resources after each client request is printed into the “decisions” txt file.
    
2. Decisions screen outputs
    Final decisions whether safe or unsafe state and if safe, then safe sequence is printed
    
4. Decision txt files for each test input 
    Currently available resources shown	
    Client request shown
    Whether request is accepted or rejected shown
    Final state - safe or unsafe - shown
    If safe, safe sequence shown
